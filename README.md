# 👋 Hello, World!

Welcome to my GitHub playground! 🚀 I'm Anto Frederic, and I'm here to code, create, and have a little fun along the way. 🎉

## About Me

📊 I'm an analytics enthusiast who loves turning data into insights and making sense of numbers. But hey, I'm not just about spreadsheets and graphs—there's more to me than meets the eye!

🏸 When I'm not crunching numbers, you'll often find me on the badminton court, smashing shuttlecocks and having a blast. It's my secret superpower!

🍳 Oh, and did I mention I'm a bit of a kitchen wizard too? Check out my culinary adventures on my Instagram page. 😋

🌍 I've even explored the world a bit—kayaking on two continents and recently taking up ice skating. Life's all about balance, right?
